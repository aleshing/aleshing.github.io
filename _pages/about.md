I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics, adivised by  [Mauricio Sadinle](http://faculty.washington.edu/msadinle/) and [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/) broadly interested in improving the statistical methodology used in human rights research and child mortality estimation. To this end, my dissertation research focuses on record linkage, multiple-systems estimation (otherwise known as capture-recapture), and models for complex survey data.

During my first year I was a research assistant in [Ruth Etzioni's group](https://research.fhcrc.org/etzioni/en.html) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I worked on estimating risk factors for prostate cancer incidence in the presence of differential screening. Currently I'm a research assistant for [Susanne May](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/susanne-may), using record linkage to link emergency medical service records to electronic health records.

Originally from Maryland, I graduated from Boston College with a B.S. in Math and a B.A. in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy drinking tea, (binge) watching tv and movies, playing tennis, rock climbing, and playing Monopoly Deal.
