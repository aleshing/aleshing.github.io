Hello! I'm a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/)  at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), adivised by  [Mauricio Sadinle](http://faculty.washington.edu/msadinle/) and [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/), broadly interested in improving the statistical methodology used in human rights research and child mortality estimation. To this end, my dissertation research focuses on [record linkage](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2021.2013242), [multiple-systems estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09304) (otherwise known as capture-recapture), and [models for complex survey data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/subnational-under-five-mortality-estimates-1990-2019/).

Since 2021 I have been a part of the research team producing estimates of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic for the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) (WHO). See the following links for  [results](https://www.who.int/data/stories/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-january-2020-december-2021), [methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09081), and [media coverage](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/WHOmedia.html).

During my first year I was a research assistant in [Ruth Etzioni's group](https://research.fhcrc.org/etzioni/en.html) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I worked on estimating risk factors for prostate cancer incidence in the presence of differential screening. During my third year I was a research assistant for [Susanne May](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/susanne-may), using record linkage to link emergency medical service records to electronic health records. Since my fourth year, I have been a research assistant working with [Public Health - Seattle & King County](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health.aspx) to use methods from my dissertation to link EMS, jail booking, and death certificate records, with the goal of understanding the incidence of overdoses following release from a King County jail. 

Originally from Maryland, I graduated from Boston College with a B.S. in Math and a B.A. in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my cat, rock climbing, and gaming (currently Slay the Spire and Super Auto Pets).
