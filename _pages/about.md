I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics, adivised by  [Mauricio Sadinle](http://faculty.washington.edu/msadinle/) and [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/) broadly interested in improving the statistical methodology used in human rights research and child mortality estimation. To this end, my dissertation research focuses on record linkage, multiple-systems estimation (otherwise known as capture-recapture), and models for complex survey data.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

During my first year I was a research assistant in [Ruth Etzioni's group](https://research.fhcrc.org/etzioni/en.html) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I worked on estimating risk factors for prostate cancer incidence in the presence of differential screening. Currently I'm a research assistant for [Susanne May](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/susanne-may), using record linkage to link emergency medical service records to electronic health records.

Originally from Maryland, I graduated from Boston College with a B.S. in Math and a B.A. in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy drinking tea, (binge) watching tv and movies, playing tennis, rock climbing, and playing Monopoly Deal.

Does markdown allow latex like text? $X\sim N(0,1)$
