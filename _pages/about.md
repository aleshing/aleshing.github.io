Hello! I'm a research mathematical statistician in the [Center for Statistical Research and Methodology](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/stat-research.html) at the  [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), adivised by  [Rebecca Steorts](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/beka). I completed my doctoral studies in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), adivised by  [Mauricio Sadinle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ua6vk8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). My dissertation research focused on [record linkage](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2021.2013242), [multiple-systems estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09304) (otherwise known as capture-recapture), and [models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00724) [for complex survey data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/subnational-under-five-mortality-estimates-1990-2019/).

Since 2021 I have been a part of the research team producing estimates of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic for the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) (WHO). See the following links for  [results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2), [methods](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-17/issue-2/Estimating-global-and-country-specific-excess-mortality-during-the-Covid/10.1214/22-AOAS1673.short), and [media coverage](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/WHOmedia.html).

Originally from Maryland, I graduated from Boston College with a B.S. in Math and a B.A. in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my cats, rock climbing, playing tennis, and gaming (currently Legends of Runeterra and Teamfight Tactics).
