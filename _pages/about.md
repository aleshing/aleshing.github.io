Hello! I'm a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), adivised by  [Beka Steorts](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/beka), broadly interested in improving the statistical methodology used in human rights research and child mortality estimation.

I completed my doctoral studies in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), adivised by  [Mauricio Sadinle](http://faculty.washington.edu/msadinle/) and [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). My dissertation research focused on [record linkage](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2021.2013242), [multiple-systems estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09304) (otherwise known as capture-recapture), and [models for complex survey data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/subnational-under-five-mortality-estimates-1990-2019/).

Since 2021 I have been a part of the research team producing estimates of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic for the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) (WHO). See the following links for  [results](https://www.who.int/data/stories/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-january-2020-december-2021), [methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09081), and [media coverage](https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/WHOmedia.html).

Originally from Maryland, I graduated from Boston College with a B.S. in Math and a B.A. in Computer Science. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my cat, rock climbing, and gaming (currently Slay the Spire, Super Auto Pets, and Temafight Tactics).
